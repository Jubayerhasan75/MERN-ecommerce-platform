## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 18+)
* MongoDB Account (A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) cluster is recommended)
* Cloudinary Account (for image uploads)

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` folder:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install the necessary npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder. Copy the contents of `.env.example` and fill in your credentials.

    **backend/.env.example**
    ```env
    # --- MongoDB Configuration ---
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

    # --- JSON Web Token (JWT) Configuration ---
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_123

    # --- Cloudinary Configuration (For Image Uploads) ---
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    ```

4.  Run the database seeder to import products and the admin user:
    ```bash
    npm run data:import
    ```


### 2. Frontend Setup

1.  From the root directory, navigate to the `frontend` folder:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
    *(If you are already in the `backend` folder, just use `cd ../frontend`)*

2.  Install the necessary npm packages. Use `--legacy-peer-deps` if you encounter peer dependency errors:
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

### 3. Running the Project

You must run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously in **two separate terminals**.

* **Terminal 1 (Backend):**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```
    *(Server will run on http://localhost:5000)*

* **Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    *(Server will run on http://localhost:3000)*

Open **`http://localhost:3000`** in your browser to see the website.
